# IR-boolean-retrieval-Model
A simple infortmation retrieval model that works on the principles of boolean retrieval

The uploaded files contain an index construction file which constructs two indexes based on inverted index mechanism
It also contains the .json files for 2 indexes that were created, one for positional queries and other for non positional queries
Finally it has a query file which is to process queries (i made queries which accept only AND and OR queries)

I didnot upload the word files (documents). With few alterations, this code can work for any set of arbitrary documents.
